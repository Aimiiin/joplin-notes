### 🗓️ January – March 2026

Start thinking about your **PFE**:

- What problems excite you most?
    
- What tools did you enjoy using?
    
- What’s feasible to build and defend?
    

Use this time to **prototype** ideas, test scalability, or conduct research/lab tests.

📁 Projects Now Become More PFE-Oriented.

Examples:

- Real-time Linux activity monitor with eBPF + frontend.
    
- AI-based phishing detection engine deployed in Kubernetes.
    
- Cloud-based log collector with live attack detection.
